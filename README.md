# Airflow-docker-container

I explored installing airflow on windows turns out to be complicated. 

I found using docker container is so far the best work-around. So this repo is just a template of the airflow docker container, feel free to use. 

Technically all you need is the `docker-compose.yml` file and of course docker engine or (docker desktop for windows) has to be installed in your environment
